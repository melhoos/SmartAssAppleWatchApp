# SmartAss IOS Apple Watch App 

This app is created at the ARIoT challenge 2017 and its purpose is to monitor youngsters. 

### What it does: 

This app can be divided into three parts:

#### 1. Temprature
The Apple watch app shows a temprature and it is updated ever 10seconds. The temprature is collected from a smart pacifier. 

#### 2. Poop or No poop
The second part is triggerd from a smart diaper. When the diaper is full the app will tell yoy that it needs to be changed. 

#### 3. Camera
Last but not least, camera. The camera-button takes a photo and reports the photo back and shows it in the mobile app. For example you can place the camera at the babys crib and you can check if the baby is asleep or not.
